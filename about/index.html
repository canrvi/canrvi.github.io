  <section class="post-content"><h5 id="welcome-to-wetransfer">Welcome to WeTransfer</h5>
<p>Founded in 2009 as the simplest way to send big files around the world, WeTransfer has since grown into an ecosystem of creative productivity tools. The company’s suite of tools is specifically designed for creative professionals, enabling collaboration, co-creation and client management across their workflow process.</p>
<p>As a certified B Corporation™, WeTransfer has long been a champion of using business as a force for good. The company famously donates 30% of its advertising real estate to raise awareness for artists and creative work.</p>
<h5 id="responsible-business">Responsible business</h5>
<p>Good ideas deserve good company, and WeTransfer has built a business with empathy at its core. WeTransfer is driven by a sense of purpose and a belief that only sustainable and responsible businesses can stay relevant in the future.</p>
<p>This core value permeates throughout the organization and impacts every aspect of WeTransfer’s business practices. The company elected to have its social and environmental performance, as well as its focus on accountability and transparency, assessed against the proprietary criteria established by B Lab, an independent non-profit organization.</p>
<p>In March 2020, WeTransfer was designated as a Certified B Corporation, confirming its ambition to strengthen its values-driven approach to responsible technology and business.</p>
<h5 id="commitment-to-the-creative-community">Commitment to the creative community</h5>
<p>WeTransfer believes creativity is the driving force behind humankind, and the company takes pride in supporting the global community of creatives who rely on its tools every single day.</p>
<p>Since the beginning WeTransfer has donated 30% of advertising real estate to raise awareness for artists, creative work, and some of the world’s most pressing issues. This has led to partnerships with artists and organizations like Björk, FKA twigs, Marina Abramović, Riz Ahmed, the Nelson Mandela Foundation, the UN Development Program and Seatrees.</p>
<p>In 2016, WeTransfer helped launch the world’s first free Masters of the Arts in design thinking with the University of the Underground, as well as Worldwide FM, a global radio station run by legendary BBC broadcaster Gilles Peterson. In 2021 the company launched The Supporting Act, a foundation designed to support emerging creative talent.</p>

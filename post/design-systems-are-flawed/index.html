<p><em>Back in the spring of 2021, the CCP (</em><a href="https://www.clubecriativos.com/"><em>Clube Criativos Portugal</em></a><em>) invited me to talk about design systems. At the time I wasn‚Äôt focused on design systems, but I decided to accept the invitation anyway. I thought that I could still speak to my own experience, as someone designing a new product and referencing one of the most well-known design systems around:</em> <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/"><em>Shopify Polaris</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Funnily enough, a couple months after my talk I found myself on the Polaris team, and adopting this new perspective helped me evolve my understanding, and develop my opinions when it comes to design systems. I figured I could share some of that with you.</em></p>
<h1 id="design-systems-are-hot">Design systems are hot!</h1>
<p>Everybody seems to be talking about design systems nowadays (#guilty) and they have become a bit of a hot commodity. It‚Äôs easy to understand why.</p>
<ol>
<li>They help with <strong>consistency</strong>, so there are fewer unique solutions for similar problems.</li>
<li>They make design and development <strong>faster</strong>.</li>
<li>They <strong>free</strong> designers and developers to focus on bigger, and more specific, problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>At least, that‚Äôs the theory‚Ä¶
In practice, I think design systems are a bit misinterpreted, which isn‚Äôt fertile ground for the best design results, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consistency becomes <strong>monotony</strong> and we lack variety and intent in our solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Speed is overrated</strong> and the momentum hinders teams from building outside the bounds of the system.</li>
<li>Designers and developers become <strong>imprisoned</strong> within the system boundaries.</li>
</ol>
